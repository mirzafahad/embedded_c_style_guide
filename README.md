# Why another style guide?

My coding style changes everytime I change my employer. Every company has their own flavor of coding style. When it comes to my personal project I tend to follow the style that I am following at work. So, different projects of mine followed different coding style depended on when I did it. 

To be consistent across my personal projects, I am writing this style guide, for __myself__, collected from different standards (Google, MISRA etc.) according to my likings.

Doesn't matter what you follow, be consistent.
